# UX
One page web application for a single player memory card game.
 
## Strategy
### Project goals
- A game with a simple look, easy to play, with intuitive instruction.
- App fully responsive on desktops, tablets and mobiles.
- Colorful images to make the game interestig for everyone.
- Enjoyable interaction developed in Javascript.
### User goals
- An entertaining game to play.
- A game that help to improve the memory, challenging enough but not too tough.
- A good looking interface, easy to read.
### User stories
- A user new to this kind of memory game wants to read clear instruction.
- A user wants to play the game without distraction or a messy screen.
- A user wants the game to be responsive and functional on any device.
- A user wants to have a positive interaction with every element of the page.
- A user need a win/lose popup message to be engaged, as well as a counter of moves.
- A user wants a reset button.
- A user wants to display his/her name.
## Scope
- This project will be part of my portfolio, showing my skills on interactive frontend development.
- The goal of this web application is to create a game with a smooth user interaction, and of course a fun game to play.
- Popup, buttons and modal messages make part of the interaction, and the game itself is a fine tuned tool that react to the user actions.
## Structure
- This is a simple single page design with two main section. 
- Responsive design, to be visualized in all screens.
- Users can quickly access all the informations, and function of the game, so the level of attention remains constant.
- Informations provided are enough and not overwhelming, some of them show up when needed to guide or alert the user.
- Animations react to actions like the user expect, and are tailored to be responsive and natural.
## Skeleton
- One page fullscreen.
- A section for main controls, like title, buttons and informations.
- A section for the card game, with a responsive matrix 4x3 that on mobiles changes to 3x4
- The footer is minimal and provide my github contact and my name.
### Wireframe

## Surface
- The visual experience is relaxing for the eyes, main colors are pale blue and light grey.
- Cards stand out with a yellow color and a round element at the center (Chartres cathedral labyrinth).
- The back face of the cards are colorful and vivid. Images of fruits stimulate the memory with different shapes and colors.
- When you lose the popup message is red, whereas is green when you win.
- Typography is simple and consistent.

- The Restart button set a new game, flip back and shuffle the cards.
- A counter displays the number of moves. To win you must complete the game in 14 moves.
- Popup messages show up when you win/lose.
- When the game end, the counter stop and the cards change their behaviour.

## Testing
- Tested the responsive behaviour of images and text on desktops, laptops, and mobiles.
- Different bugs show up during the development of the javascript code, the first was the check for a match between two card. I ended up defining a first and second card variables.
- "Stop flipping card" was a function that needed a timeout in order to see the rotation of the second card (give enough time to memorize the card that didnâ€™t match) before it flips back.
- If you click fast enough you can rotate three cards at the time and have an incorrect behaviour. The bug is fixed by simplifying the Match-function and adding a remove-event-listener
- Button "Reset" clear the number of moves, flips back and shuffle the cards.
- Button "Change name" opens a modal window with a form, a save button and a close button. The save button dysplay correctly the Name in the dashboard.
- Button "How to play" opens a modal window with the instructions on how to play.
- Win/Lose popups are centered in the viewport and show a lovely animation right after the Win/Lose event.
- After you Lose, you are not longer able to flip the cards, so you can play again by clicking the "Reset" button.
- Tested the external link, it opened in a new tab and went to the correct page.
