- The goal of this web application is to create a game with a smooth user interaction, and of course a fun game to play.
- Popup, buttons and modal messages make part of the interaction, and the game itself is a fine tuned tool that react to the user actions.
## Structure
- This is a simple single page design with two main section. 
- Responsive design, to be visualized in all screens.
- Users can quickly access all the informations, and function of the game, so the level of attention remains constant.
- Informations provided are enough and not overwhelming, some of them show up when needed to guide or alert the user.
- Animations react to actions like the user expect, and are tailored to be responsive and natural.
## Skeleton
- One page fullscreen.
- A section for main controls, like title, buttons and informations.
- A section for the card game, with a responsive matrix 4x3 that on mobiles changes to 3x4
- The footer is minimal and provide my github contact and my name.
